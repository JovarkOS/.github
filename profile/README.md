## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ff671b9bc9447eb77c5fa275073eaeb87c8ca191/74991/assets/jovarkos-desktop.jpg)


## Built With

Like many other Linux distros, JovarkOS is based on Arch Linux, which is 
> "a lightweight and flexible LinuxÂ® distribution that tries to Keep It Simple." [^1]

We do have to admit, JovarkOS doesn't strictly fall in the footsteps of Arch Linux,  as the goal isn't to provide a base for a GNU/Linux system, but rather a complete bundle of software which needs only minimal personalization and configuration to start.

### Prerequisites

The easiest way to get started is to flash a USB drive (3+ GB total space needed) with [ventoy](https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy), or by using any of the following tools: 
 - [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) (Windows, Linux, MacOS)
 - [Rufus](https://rufus.ie) (Windows)
 - [dd](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/creating-a-bootable-ubuntu-usb-stick-on-a-debian-linux/) (Linux, MacOS)

JovarkOS boots in either BIOS[^2] or UEFI[^3] mode. You may need to disable SecureBoot[^4].

### Installation

JovarkOS currently uses the Calamares installer. Please note Calamares may or may not work at any given time because of the time needed to build and test the various Calamares packages. 

In that case, please follow the instructions located on the [Arch Linux Installation Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide). Configuration files can be found in the [JovarkOS Development Environment](https://github.com/jovarkos/jovarkos-dev-env/) repository.

## Roadmap
